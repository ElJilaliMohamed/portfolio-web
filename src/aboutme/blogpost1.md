Quite the comical introduction that led to serious consequences haha.

Two major twists had small gaps that let my intuition predict them.

Nonetheless, they were nicely connected together in execution.

Diverse & dynamic written characters.
Certainly recommend it to film freaks to experience it yourself & come up with your own conclusion.

Really enjoyed watching a film on a big screen after so much time. 
Definitely a more immersive experience than watching on a computer!
Probably the best 2 hours and 50 minutes of that day.
