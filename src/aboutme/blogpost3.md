I'm making my own manga for future publication. I think I will finish this 74-page story due January & submit it to contests & publishers and see which ones are interested in my work!

Between Wasteland's Fate is an original story, at the moment I'm fixing some parts of the storyboard, because I'm trying to give it a compelling & satisfying ending.
