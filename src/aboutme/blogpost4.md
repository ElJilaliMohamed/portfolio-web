The Creative Act: A way of Being (Dutch edition) opened my perception of life as an artist.

From amplifying the consciousness to the conception of ideas to the materialization of those ideas. This book made me a better creative & human being in general.

It's not an overstatement if I said that I'm a better human being. Maybe i've put it vaguely, I meant that it spiritually made me fulfilled through the creative process of ups & downs.

Definitely my favorite book, I certainly recommend it!
