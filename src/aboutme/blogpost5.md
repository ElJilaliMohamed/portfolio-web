I love coffee... a lot.

When I'm drawing, reading, working for school or watching a film, a cup of coffee is patiently waiting for my slurps at the corner of my desk!

With a friend I went to this "Izy" cafe and had an amazing sensation of savours from the Peanut Caramel Choc coffee drink, definitely my next pic for my next visit!

When I have a busy day? Black coffee. one teaspoon of sugar.

Wanting to relax & watch a film? Cappucino, sometimes with chocolate & haver drink.

I don't have more than 3 cups a day, though! That's about it.
